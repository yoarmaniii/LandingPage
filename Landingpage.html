<h2>About AlphaByt!
    </h2>

<body>
    <p> Armani b.k.a. "AlphaByt" is a junior Whitehat Software Developer from Detroit, MI.
        <br>His job is to fight crime on a digital level and no threat scares him away.
        <br> Applications, information, and businesses are things that "Alpha" thrives on protecting from outside threats.
         <br>With a very inquisitive and peculiar nature, "Alpha" goes in randomly and generates what he calls "AlphaBIT" tests.
        <br> These series of tests point out vulnerable spots in businesses network mainframes and applications.
        <br> Even with a odd psuedonym, "AlphaByt" gets the job done with precision and with haste. Although getting in contact
        <br>with him can be tricky, he always has a way of finding you when you least expect it.
